# Smart-Object-Detection-
Developed a system which enhances autonomous vehicle safety and traffic monitoring using YOLOv5n for real-time object detection and an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement on a Raspberry Pi. It identifies objects like cars and dividers, providing labels, confidence scores, and distances to improve risk detection.
